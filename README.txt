The program loads a default arrangement of 5 C1 contiguous bezier curves
when first opened. Each of the 5 curves have a unique color. While the program is running,
the program outputs “diagnostics” to the console such as which node was clicked and which 
drop-down options were selected.

Editing Control Points:
	Simply left click and drag to edit the position of control points.
	
Menu (Right click to open):
	- Save File: Saves the current arrangement of bezier curves to a
				.txt file named “Hw4Output.txt” to the working directory 
				that can be read by the program so you can pick up where you
				left off.
	- Load File: Loads the most recently saved version of
				“Hw4Output.txt” form the working directory and displays the curves
				on the screen.
	- Toggle Guide Lines: Toggles on and off the lines that connect the
				control points to make things easier to see if desired.
	- Quit: Closes the program.

NOTE: Control points may glitch out when dragged off screen, but they will correct
themselves if you move them again.
