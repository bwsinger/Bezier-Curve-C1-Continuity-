## About
The program loads a default arrangement of 5 C1 contiguous bezier curves
when first opened. Each of the 5 curves have a unique color. While the program is running,
the program outputs “diagnostics” to the console such as which node was clicked and which
drop-down options were selected.

## To Run:
1. Download the exec file
2. Double click the exec file (right click and select 'open' if this doesn't work) OR In terminal, type in the path to the exec file

    ex: ~/Downloads/Bezier-Curve-C1-Continuity-/exec

## Editing Control Points:
Simply left click and drag to edit the position of control points.

## Menu (Right click to open):
###### Save File:
Saves the current arrangement of bezier curves to a .txt file named “Hw4Output.txt” to the working directory that can be read by the program so you can pick up where you left off.
###### Load File:
Loads the most recently saved version of “Hw4Output.txt” form the working directory and displays the curves on the screen.
###### Toggle Guide Lines:
Toggles on and off the lines that connect the control points to make things easier to see if desired.
###### Quit:
Closes the program.

## NOTE:
Control points may glitch out when dragged off screen, but they will correct
themselves if you move them again.
